	/* Assignment #2 - Choose Your Own Adventure

This week, we learn about conditional statements: the ability for your code to make decisions based on the state of its variables, perhaps one of the most fundamental capabilities a computer has. To commemorate this milestone, we'll write a primitive Choose Your Own Adventure story like it's 1988.

Using the console.log, prompt(), and confirm functions, write a simple interactive text adventure with at least four different endings (i.e., two branches each leading to two more branches). At least one choice should require inputting a number and comparing it to one or more other numeric values, and at least one choice should use a boolean.

Your script can cover any situation imaginable, and does not have to be fiction. Suggestions include:

A guide to restaurants in your neighborhood
An interactive how-to for some DIY project
A troubleshooting process for a machine or program
The world's shortest spy novel*/
